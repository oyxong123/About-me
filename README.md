- Hii, I'm currently a college student and studying computer science
- I just recently started to really dip my toes into the world of programming by self learning instead of relying college materials
- And I realise that's the best decision I ever made
- Currently exploring the capabilities of github
- Programming languages that I'm expanding my knowledge on are C and Python
- I'm interested in building audio related projects and other misc projects that will help with my everyday workflow
- Also looking through other people's source code to understand how to write good code
- Hope I can learn a lot from you guys ~
